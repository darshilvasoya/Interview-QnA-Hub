## Question
What is a Python decorator?

## Answer
- A decorator is a function that modifies another function.  
- It allows adding extra functionality without changing the original code.
```
```python
def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function call")
        func()
        print("After function call")
    return wrapper

@decorator
def hello():
    print("Hello World")

hello()
```
